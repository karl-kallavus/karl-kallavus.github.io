            <p>Design Systems: Are they worth it?</p>
            <p>
              There has been a lot of noise around Design Systems, some love
              them, some are skeptical. Based on my experience with our own
              Design System I'll separate the reality from hype. After this
              session, you’ll be able to make a decision about whether to invest
              your technology into a Design System armed with an understanding
              of the risks and benefits.
