        <p>Design Systems: Are they worth it?</p>
        <p>
          There has been a lot of noise around Design Systems, some love them,
          some are skeptical. Based on my experience with our own Design System
          I'll separate the reality from hype. After this session, you’ll be
          able to make a decision about whether to invest your technology into a
          Design System armed with an understanding of the risks and benefits.
